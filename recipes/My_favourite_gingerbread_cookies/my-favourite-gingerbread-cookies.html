        Whenever I think of Christmas cookies, gingerbread cookies come to mind first.<br>
        Well, after Christmas sugar cookies of course! Their spice, their molasses flavor, <br> SMILES, and their charm are obviously irresistible.
        Gingerbread cookies, you have my heart.

            Key Ingredients in Gingerbread Cookies 
        </h2>
        <p>
            The full written recipe is below, but letâ€™s review a few key ingredients here first.<br>
            Gingerbread cookie recipes all start the same and mine comes from my mom.<br>
            To her recipe, I add a little more molasses and increase the amount of spice flavors (cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and allspice).<br>
            Because of the added sticky sweetener (molasses), I add a little more flour to help soak it all up.<br>
            Just like when we are making pinwheel cookies, a bit of extra flour helps the cookies can keep their shape.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Molasses + spices</strong> for flavor</li>
                <li><strong>Egg </strong>so the gingerbread cookies have structure and richness</li>
                <li><strong>Brown</strong> sugar instead of white granulated sugar. I always use brown sugar when its flavor fits.</li>
            </ol>

    <h2>How to Make Gingerbread Cookies</h2>
    <p>
        Letâ€™s walk through the gingerbread cookie recipe so you feel confident when you begin baking.
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong> Chill the dough:</strong> The dough is sticky once itâ€™s all beaten together in your mixing bowl and therefore, <br>
       it absolutely MUST be chilled for at least 3 hours. Give yourself enough time in the kitchen or make the cookie dough and chill it overnight. <br>
       You want your cookie dough firm so the cookies hold their shape and you want your cookie dough manageable so you can work with it.<br>
       You wonâ€™t have either unless you have chilled cookie dough!
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong> Wrap up the dough: </strong>Itâ€™s easiest to wrap the dough in plastic wrap before chilling. Scoop out 1/2 of the prepared cookie dough,<br>
       plop it onto a long sheet of plastic wrap, wrap it up, and flatten it out into a disc. Repeat with the other 1/2 of dough. <br>
       Then chill. See that photo above? Thatâ€™s what youâ€™re doing, but youâ€™ll have 2 discs. Why are you doing this? <br>
       Itâ€™s easier to roll out the chilled cookie dough when it is in a disc shape. Also, the cookie dough chills faster when there is less volume. <br>
       And itâ€™s just easier to work with smaller portions when rolling/shaping!
    </p>
    <p>
       <strong> Roll it out:</strong> After chilling, roll out the chilled cookie dough discs until about 1/4-inch thick. Donâ€™t be afraid to flour your hands, <br>
       rolling pin, work surface, and everything in the world. By that, I mean: the cookie dough can become sticky as you work.<br> 
       So, donâ€™t be scared to add more flour to the work surface. The flour spots on top of your shaped cookie dough will bake off.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
        Place the cut-out cookies onto a lined baking sheet about 1 inch apart. <br>
        The cookies wonâ€™t really spread, but you want to make sure they have enough room to breathe. They are gingerbread people, after all. ðŸ˜‰

        <h2>How to Decorate Gingerbread Cookies</h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        After theyâ€™ve baked and cooled, itâ€™s time to decorate the cookies. Weâ€™re talking smiles, eyes, bow-ties, buttons, squiggles, <br>
        whatever your gingerbread cookie loving heart desires. This is when itâ€™s really fun to have a friend or little baker in the kitchen with you. <br>
        You can use the easy cookie icing or my traditional royal icing recipe, whichever you prefer.<br>
        For something even easier, you can decorate the gingerbread cookies with cookie decorating buttercream, and feel free <br> 
        to add a little cinnamon to it for extra spice flavor.
    </p>
    <p>
        Tint the icing with a couple drops of food coloring to spice things up, too.
    </p>

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <form>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, ginger, cinnamon, allspice, and cloves. Set aside.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>In a large bowl using a handheld mixer or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the butter for 1 minute on medium speed until completely smooth and creamy. <br>
                Add the brown sugar and molasses and beat on medium high speed until combined and creamy. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.<br>
                Next, beat in egg and vanilla on high speed for 2 full minutes. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed. The butter may separate; thatâ€™s ok.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>Add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients, and beat on low speed until combined. The cookie dough will be quite thick and slightly sticky.<br>
                Divide dough in half and place each onto a large piece of plastic wrap. Wrap each up tightly and pat down to create a disc shape. <br>
                Chill discs for at least 3 hours and up to 3 days. Chilling is mandatory for this cookie dough. I always chill mine overnight.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350Â°F (177Â°C). Line 2-3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. (Always recommended for cookies.) Set aside.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>Remove 1 disc of chilled cookie dough from the refrigerator. Generously flour a work surface, as well as your hands and the rolling pin. <br>
                Roll out disc until 1/4-inch thick. Tips for rollingâ€”the dough may crack and be crumbly as you roll. Whatâ€™s helpful is picking it up and rotating it as you go. <br>
                Additionally, you can use your fingers to help meld the cracking edges back together. <br>
                The first few rolls are always the hardest since the dough is so stiff, but re-rolling the scraps is much easier. Cut into shapes. <br>
                Place shapes 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets. Re-roll dough scraps until all the dough is shaped. Repeat with remaining disc of dough.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>Bake cookies for about 9-10 minutes. If your cookie cutters are smaller than 4 inches, bake for about 8 minutes.<br>
                If your cookie cutters are larger than 4 inches, bake for about 11 minutes. My oven has hot spots and yours may tooâ€”so be sure to rotate the pan once during bake time. <br>
                Keep in mind that the longer the cookies bake, the harder and crunchier theyâ€™ll be. For soft gingerbread cookies, follow my suggested bake times.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>Allow cookies to cool for 5 minutes on the cookie sheet. Transfer to cooling rack to cool completely. Once completely cool, decorate as desired.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
            <li>Cookies stay fresh covered at room temperature for up to 1 week.</li>
            </p>
