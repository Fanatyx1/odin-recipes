       <h2> Waht are Lace cookies? </h2>
    </p>
    <p>
        Lace cookies are very thin and crunchy cookies made from butter, sugar, salt, and other ingredients. <br>
        The other ingredients vary depending on the recipe. Some recipes use oats and flour, other lace cookie recipes use nuts. <br>
        Lace cookies get their name from their delicate and see-through appearance. My mom always used to make these—they’re a beautiful cookie!<br>
        They’re also one of my favorite gluten free dessert recipes. It’s nice to have a gluten free option among your spread of Christmas cookies!

            <li><label><input type="checkbox" name="ingrediens_list">2/3 cup (130g) packed light or dark<strong> brown sugar</strong></label></li>
            <li><label><input type="checkbox" name="ingrediens_list"></label>3/4 cup (75g) <strong>almond flour</strong></li>

            <li><label><input type="checkbox" name="ingrediens_list">1 Tablespoon (15ml) <strong>light or dark corn syrup</strong> or<strong> milk</strong></label></li>
            <li><label><input type="checkbox" name="ingrediens_list">1 teaspoon <strong>pure vanilla extract</strong></label></li>
            <li><label><input type="checkbox" name="ingrediens_list">optional: 1/2 cup <strong>Nutella</strong> or <strong>melted chocolate</strong> (see note)</label></li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Instrictions</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <p>
                <li>Melt butter in a medium saucepan on low heat. Once melted, add the brown sugar, almond flour, salt, and milk/corn syrup. <br>
                Cook and whisk until sugar has dissolved and ingredients are completely combined, around 3-4 minutes. <br>
                (Note: If melted butter is separating from the mixture, remove the pan from heat and vigorously whisk until it is all combined again.<br>
                It will eventually come back together.)</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>Remove from heat and whisk in vanilla extract. Mixture will be grainy and shiny. <br>
                    Allow cookie dough to sit and thicken for about 5-10 minutes as the oven preheats. The mixture will thicken as it cools down.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>Preheat oven to 350°F (177°C). Line 2-3 large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>Drop scant teaspoonfuls (1 scant teaspoon of mixture per cookie, not Tablespoon) 3 inches apart onto prepared baking sheets. <br>
                Bake for 6-8 minutes until golden brown around the edges. The edges and centers will sizzle and bubble as the cookies bake!</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>Allow cookies to cool for 5 full minutes on the baking sheets before transferring to a rack to cool completely. Cookies dry and crisp up as they cool.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>Once cool, enjoy cookies or sandwich with Nutella or melted chocolate. <br>
                To sandwich, spread either Nutella or melted chocolate onto the bottom of one cooled cookie and sandwich with another. See recipe note if using chocolate.</li>
            </p>
            <p>
                <li>Cookies without Nutella/chocolate filling will stay fresh covered at room temperature for 1 week.<br>
                Cookies with Nutella/chocolate will stay fresh covered at room temperature for 3 days or in the refrigerator for 1 week.</li>
